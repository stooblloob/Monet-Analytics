# Evaluating the Models
$AIC$ which stands for Akaike Information Criterion, evaluates how well the model fits the data. This is calculated from the number of independent variables in the model and how well the model reproduces the data. We are looking for the best-fit model that explains the greatest amount of variation using the fewest possible independent variables. Generally speaking, lower the $AIC$, the better the model.

$R^2$ is the goodness of fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively. $R^2$ measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 â€“ 100% scale. Similarly, the higher the $R^2$, the better the model.
