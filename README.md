# Evaluating the Models
AIC which stands for Akaike Information Criterion, evaluates how well the model fits the data. This is calculated from the number of independent variables in the model and how well the model reproduces the data. We are looking for the best-fit model that explains the greatest amount of variation using the fewest possible independent variables. The lower the AIC, the better the model.
